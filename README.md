### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. While working on the View Controllers, I had a difficult time comprehending the connections between MovieGridViewController and MovieGridCell. However, I am beginning to understand the concepts of Swift coding. Working on a few more project will give a clearer picture on how things works.
